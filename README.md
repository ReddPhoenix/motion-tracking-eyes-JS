Deployed app: [Motion Tracking Eyes](https://reddphoenix.github.io/motion-tracking-eyes-JS/)
## **Description**
Motion Tracking Eyes app was created using a tutorial from Chris Bongers. I modified the CSS to apply two different gradients to the inner and outer eye that changes according to the movement of the mouse around the screen.
